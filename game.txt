* Who are you?
    I can't tell you that
    
    * Where are we?
        We're in dark basement in the middle of nowhere. There's nothing to be scared of.
    * Why are we here?
        That's nothing for you to worry about.
    * What do I see?
        [WhatIsee]
            Just me. And the creepy crawlies around.

            * Creepy crawlies? Are they dangerous?
                Don't be silly! As long as you don't annoy them, they will leave you alone.
            * How did you take me here?
                I used all the old tricks: knocked you out while you were alone, took you in my van, put you here, and that's it, for now anyway...
            * What do I do?
                [WhatIdo]
                    Not much, really. There are a few things that you can try, though.
                    
                    * Can I call someone?
                        Don't be silly, there's no signal under here. Did those days out to the countryside teach you nothing?
                    * Can I run?
                        If you want to die, run. However, it is a painful death...
                    * Can you take me away?
                        I could, but I don't want to. Honestly, you get kidnapped and expect your kidnapper to take you away? Tut tut.
                    * What else can I do?
                        [WhatelsetoDo]
                            You can enjoy the peace. Just me and you, calm and quiet. 
                            * Why are you so cryptic?
                                I always have been.
                            * Why did you kidnap me?
                                It's a long story. You needn't worry about it, however,
                            * What do you look like?
                                I look like a human (obviously)
                            * What if I escape?
                                [escape]
                                It's a very hard task to do. Try it!
                                * I give up.
                                    [takeyouaway]
                                    Finally, you said it. Most of my victims die in the first few minutes. You've survived to the very end. Congrats! I will now set you free
                                    * Wait, you are taking me back?
                                        Yep.
                                    * Let's go then!
                                        As long as you promise to never tell anyone about this.
                                    * leave
                                        [endofgame]
